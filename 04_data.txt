= Compound Data: Objects =

///

Outline:

- introduce flat objects as way to collect different data together.
- match this against domain modelling. ie, if we have a book, we may
  have a title, author, pub year, which naturally models as
  { title : string, author : string, year: number }
- some examples using that (and the design recipe!)
- introduce bigBang, showing how you can use it, and images, to make
  games!
- extended examples and then extended exercise building a real game!

Note: We're not sure what this illustration is for, but maybe it will gain some purpose.

(((Babbage+++,+++ Charles)))(((object)))(((data structure)))numbers,
booleans, images, and strings are the bricks that ((data)) structures are
built from. But you can't make much of a house out of a single
brick. _Objects_ allow us to group values—including other
objects—together and thus build more complex structures.
