Right now, the outline of topics thus far (order they are introduced):

1.

numbers
arithmetic
print
precedence
strings
images - circle, rectangle
overlay
booleans
comparisons
&& and ||
undefined / null
type coercion

2.

expresions vs statements
variables
keywords
environment
functions (built in)
return values
defining functions
emptyScene
placeImage
scene function based on position
animate
if/else if/else
animation with branching
comments


NOTE(dbp 2016-02-11): Proposed changes:
- move variables/keywords/environment into chapter 1, after images
- move booleans / comparisons / &&/|| to chapter 2, to be near if.
- move placeImage/emptyScene to chapter 1, as they are helpful to draw nice images.
- move comments to be right at the beginning
